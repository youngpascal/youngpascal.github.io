### A personal website using the [jekyll-developr](https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll) template

I decided to re-vamp my personal website that I haven't touched since my initial post-grad job search in 2016. I am using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
